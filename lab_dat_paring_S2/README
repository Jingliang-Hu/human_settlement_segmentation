This folder contains codes to pair OSM label and Sentinel-2 image patches. 


Descriptions of files:

0_generate_dat_and_lab_classification.py
With given OSM label files, this script automatically finds the corresponding Sentinel-2 image from So2Sat S2 database and pairs S2 patches with OSM labels patches.
Inputs:
  - label_dir			-- Directory to the osm label (GeoTiff) of a city
  - data_store 			-- Directory to the Sentinel-2 database 
				   For example, '/datastore/DATA/classification/SEN2/global_utm/' 
  - patch_label_perc_thres	-- The percentage of a image patch that are labeled
  - patch_size			-- The size of a image patch, e.g. '32': 32 by 32 image patch
  - shift_perc			-- The overlaping rate of adjacent image patches (0.0-1.0)
Outputs:
  Paired S2 image patches and OSM labels which are stored as H5 files in "../data/s2_data_patch/".


1_batch_processing_data_generation.py
This script calls "0_generate_dat_and_lab_classification.py" to accomplish the label-data paring for cities, whose OSM label files are available.
Inputs:
  - parameters			-- Set parameters from line 4 to line 13
Outputs:
  - paired data for multiple cities in "../data/s2_data_patch/"


2_data_organization.py
This script organizes data into h5 files so that they can be easily used in training deep models.
Options in the script:
  - Season		-- One can selection on of the four seasons or all of them
  - Unknown class 	-- If true, the values are set as 0 for all pixels that are set as unknown class


9_visual_dat_and_lab.py
A script for visualizing image and label pairs.
