This folder saves the rasterized OSM labels in GeoTiff. 
1. The GeoTiffs have a GSD of 10 meters. 


2. The GeoTiffs have four bands:
	a: commercial buildings
	b: industrial buildings
	c: residential buildings
	d: others buildings


3. The values in the Geotiffs are decimal numbers which indicate the area percentages.
	For example:
	one pixel = [0.2,0.4,0.1,0.3]. 
	It means: 
		20% of the pixel is commercial buildings;
		40% of the pixel is industrial buildings;
		10% of the pixel is residential buildings;
		30% of the pixel is buildings other than the previous three;


4. If the values of all bands are 0 for a pixel, we don't know the label for this pixel. It might be one of the above four classes. It also might not. This pixel has a class of unknown.


5. The sum of values across bands for one pixel could be larger than 1. Because there exists multiple tags for different layers of the building, e.g. basement, multiple floors
