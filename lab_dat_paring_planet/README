This folder contains codes to pair OSM label and planet image patches. 

Descriptions of files:

0_upsample_planet_2_GSD3m.py
Upsample the planet images ('/data/wang/DATA/PLANET/BASEMAP_LCZ1692/') to 3 meter GSD label and geocoded in WGS84/UTM zone.
The outputs are saved in '../data/planet/'


1_lab_dat_paring_v2.py
Paring osm label and planet data. Label and data does not has to have the same GSD. 
The correspondence is calculated based on coordinates and land areas. (label_GSD * label_patch_size)=(data_GSD * data_patch_size)
Inputs:
  - label_dir			-- Directory to the osm label (GeoTiff) of a city
  - data_store 			-- Directory to the planet images of a city 
				   For example, '../data/planet/00085_206167_Sydney' 
  - patch_label_perc_thres	-- The percentage of a image patch that are labeled
  - patch_size			-- The size of a image patch, e.g. '128': 128 by 128 image patch
  - shift_perc			-- The overlaping rate of adjacent image patches (0.0-1.0)
Outputs:
  Paired planet image patches and OSM labels which are stored as H5 files in "../data/planet_data_patch/".



2_batch_processing_data_generation.py
This script calls "1_lab_dat_paring_v2.py" to accomplish the label-data paring for cities, whose OSM label files are available.
Inputs:
  - parameters			-- Set parameters from line 5 to line 10
Outputs:
  - paired data for multiple cities in "../data/planet_data_patch/"


3_data_organization.py
This script organizes data into h5 files so that they can be easily used in training deep models. 
Output is saved in '../data/planet_train'
Options in the script:
  - Unknown class 	  -- If true, the values are set as 0 for all pixels that are set as unknown class
